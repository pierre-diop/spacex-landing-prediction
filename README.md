## SpaceX Capstone Project: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success
This project focuses on predicting whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The ability to predict successful landings has significant implications for reducing launch costs and increasing the competitiveness of SpaceX's rocket launches.

### Objective
Can we build a machine learning model to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing?
The cost of a Falcon 9 rocket launch is approximately $62 million, compared to competitors charging upwards of $165 million. Predicting landing success helps evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a launch.

### Data
The dataset includes historical data related to Falcon 9 launches, such as:

Launch details (date, payload, customer, etc.).
Flight and mission outcomes.
First-stage landing success indicators.
The dataset was compiled using publicly available information from SpaceX's website and other relevant sources.

### Evaluation
The success of the project is measured by the accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting landing outcomes. The focus is on building a reliable model capable of distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful landings.

### Workflow
1. Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and preprocess launch data, including outcomes and technical details.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate trends, correlations, and key factors affecting landing success.
3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features to improve model performance.
4. Modeling: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict landing success.
5. Evaluation and Optimization: Fine-tune the model for better accuracy and robustness.
